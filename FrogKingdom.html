    <h2>Frog Kingdom</h2>
    <p>Adventure game created in Unity!</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="page__content">
    <p> For a more detailed description of this project and my role check out my blog post <a href="https://samuelwrightportfilio.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/2d-3d-4d-frog-kingdom/">here!</a></p>

    <p>Frog Kingdom would be my first independently produced game created using Unity. I challenged myself to build an entire playable game using only assets, scripts and music I had made myself.
<br>
<br>
    Like most projects I have been a part of, Frog Kingdoms purpose was to convey a meaningful message. The message I decided to communicate through this game was 
    linked heavily with the current movements to spread awarness of the possible climate disasters we face, in particular, The responasbility we all have to stop
    using and littering single-use plastics.
    <br>
    <br>
    This game would follow traditional adventure game design but the enemies the player would face represented spilt oil and disgarded plastics that threatened the future of the Frog Kingdom!
