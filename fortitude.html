<div class="page__content">
    <p> For a more detailed description of this project and my role check out my blog post <a href="https://samuelwrightportfilio.wordpress.com/2019/11/02/understanding-and-using-methods-of-research/">here!</a></p>

    <p>Fortitude would be my first major project in Unity. In a team of 3 i was delegated the job of developer meaning the coding and interactivity side of our game would be my main job but I would also help in creating 3D assets such as my <a href="EnviromentPack.html">enviroment pack</a>.
<br>
<br>
    After an early change of direction from our initial idea, My team decided Fortitude should be a classic 3 lane endless runner game in which the player character, named Pari, would rescue lost spirits from the plane between life and death aided by here spirit animal, a hawk.
    <br>
    <br>
    My first job as developer of Fortitude was creating the players movement mechanics. The main gameplay aspect of an endless runner is the players movement so it was important to get this part right. I modeled my movement mechanics on the movement system of existing (lane) endless runners such as Temple Run. I felt it was important to create an instant and reactive lane switching script to ensure input delays didn't negatively affect the players experience.

<p>The next concept we wanted to include in our game was collecting points (Energy Balls) that would act as the players score and in a more developed stage allow the player to use and unclock special abilities</p>

<p>Now that i had created the basic concepts and gameplay mechanics of an endless runner game I decided to move onto creating the mechanics that were unique to our game. The main concept that was expected from the start was allowing the players hawk companion to fire a beam of energy towards enemy animals to purify and save them from evil spirits. I decided to acheive this by adding a disabled cube to the hawk that would enable and act as a trigger when the player met certain requirments such as having sufficient energy</p>

<p>As the deadline for this project aproached we uploaded our prototype game to Itch.IO in the hopes of reciveing some playtest feedback and possibly advice from more experience developers!</p>
